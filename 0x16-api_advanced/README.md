## 0x16. API advanced

In this project, I stil work with APIs, but this time, I am learning about API documentation, pagination, and querying strings using an API as an example: the Reddit API.

Some of the concepts I learned in this project include:
- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints I need
- How to use an API with pagination
- Query Strings
- Clean URLs
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to use the Reddit API to get information on a given subreddit
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value
