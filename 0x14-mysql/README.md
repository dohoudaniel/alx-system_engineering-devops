## 0x14-mysql

In this project, I aim at installing a specific version of MySQL on my web server (Version 5.7.x), and setting up other MySQL configurations.

I learned the following concepts:
- What A Primary Replica Cluster is
- Setting up a MYSQL primary replica setup
- BUilding a robust database backup strategy
- The `mysqldump` command (see mysqldump.md).
