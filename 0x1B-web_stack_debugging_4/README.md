## 0x1B-web_stack_debugging_4

In this project, I learn about debugging webstacks and web servers.
<br>
Some of the concepts learned and used in this project are:
- Setting Up Nginx to work under pressure
- Using ApacheBench for benchmarking
- Simulation of HTTP requests to a web server.
- Changing an OS Configuration
- Changing the OS configuration so that it is possible to login a user and open a file without any error message.
